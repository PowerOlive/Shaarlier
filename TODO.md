I know, a todo file is never a good practice

## To be done before any new feature :
- Close keyboard immediatly after sending link
- In description field, enable caps and autocomplete
- Reduce font size in description field
- Increase time-out when saving link
- Description, title and tags fields deleted in landscape
- Figure out bugs in tags : probably save tags one the device and perform offline search.

## To be done future releases
- Save link from main menu
- Create a post with no link
- Save link in a draft in case of an error
- Edit/Show link when sharing

## Q&A
- Try app on as many apps as possible
- Try more device screen sizes
- Try in low network conditions

## Long term evolutions
- See online Shaarli links
- Multiple Shaarlis
- Save link later
- notifications for shaarli.fr
- But please, not too much : KISS
