I know, a todo file is never a good practice

## To do ASAP
- Feature : Handle redirection (E.g : shaarli.fr)
- Feature : accept self-signed SSL certs (see : https://github.com/dimtion/Shaarlier/issues/7)
- Bug : app crash in low network conditions
- Speed up share when no dialog must be open

- Bug : autocomplete field is hidden by keyboard when a description is too long (help needed!)

## Planned for future releases
- Save link in a draft in case of an error
- Nicer UI

## Q&A
- Try app on as many apps as possible
- Try more device screen sizes
- Try in low network conditions
- Try on slow devices

## Long term evolutions
- See online Shaarli links
- Multiple Shaarli(s)
- Save link later
- Notifications for shaarli.fr
- Try to stay KISS
