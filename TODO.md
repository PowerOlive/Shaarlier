I know, a todo file is never a good practice

## To be done before any new feature
- Handle redirection (with some strange shaarlis)
- Look how to accept self-signed SSL certs
- Speed up share when no dialog must be open

## Planned for future releases
- Save link from main menu
- Create a post with no link
- Save link in a draft in case of an error
- Edit/Show link when sharing
- Nicer UI

## Q&A
- Try app on as many apps as possible
- Try more device screen sizes
- Try in low network conditions

## Long term evolutions
- See online Shaarli links
- Multiple Shaarli(s)
- Save link later
- Notifications for shaarli.fr
- Try to stay KISS
