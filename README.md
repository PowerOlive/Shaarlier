# Shaarlier
A simple app to share links on Shaarli.

## Features
- Select your Shaarli server
- Publish links
- Select private or public sharing mode
- Automatically add a title to your links (as Shaarli does)

## Planned features
- Default template
- Optionnal dialog box for editing title, description or tags

## Why ?
I made this app beacause the official one doesn't feels right to me, in some cases you just need to save a link for reading it later. So launching the browser for that is too long for the user...
Also, for learning...
