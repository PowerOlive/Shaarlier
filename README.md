## Use it !
1. Download the app

3. Share with the Android *share* button
4. ???
5. Profit.

## Why ?
I made this app because the official one doesn't feels right to me, in some cases you just need to save a link for reading it later. So launching the browser for that only task is quite too long (you know, I like when things are fast and easy).
