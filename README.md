# Shaarlier
A simple app to share links on your Shaarli.

## Features :
- Publish links on your Shaarli
- Automatically add a title to your links (as Shaarli does)
- Optional dialog box for editing title, description or tags
- Fast publishing mode (just press share and your link is on your Shaarli)

## Planned features :
- Templates
- Share links from main interface
- Manage your Shaarli

## Why ?
I made this app because the official one doesn't feels right to me, in some cases you just need to save a link for reading it later. So launching the browser for that only task is quite too long (you know I like when things are fast).
